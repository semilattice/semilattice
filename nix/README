Pinning Nixpkgs works by simply fetchTarballing a version of Nixpkgs, and using
that everywhere. The entry point is default.nix in the repository root. You can
build things using nix-build -A, and it will automatically use the pinned
Nixpkgs version. For example, to build DEET you would type the following
command from the repository root:

    nix-build -A deet
