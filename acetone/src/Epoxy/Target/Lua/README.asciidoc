= Lua target

The Lua target generates Lua source code.

== Runtime

The runtime is included before and after the generated code. You can find the
source code in the prologue.lua and epilogue.lua files.

== Globals

Globals are lazily initialized. This allows for cyclic dependencies between
globals.

== Runtime representation

No Acetone value should have nil as its runtime representation in Lua. This is
because assigning nil to a table field deletes the table field, breaking the
guarantees of the hash table intrinsics.
