The files in this directory help with building DEET.

To build DEET it is necessary to have a running PostgreSQL instance, which
will be used at compile time to type check SQL code. By doing this, the build
will fail when schema changes are made without the corresponding source code
changes. Since Nix builders run in a new network namespace, we can just start
a PostgreSQL instance in the builder.
