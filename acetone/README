Acetone is a programming language.

The behavioral part of the language is similar to that of PureScript: lambda
calculus with an expressive type system.

The organizational part of the language is similar to that of C: there is one
big namespace for all global definitions, compilation units may all be compiled
in parallel, and interface files are written by hand (although no textual
inclusion is used for sharing them; rather the compiler accepts multiple source
files to form one compilation unit).
